# PythonByOla
This is a proud mentor's collection of Python codes by my favorite student Ola 

Unfortunately despite creating this repository several years ago, I never got to upload any of her works.
I recently lost my baby sister and Mentee Ola, and I will seek to find every file she sent me and reupload it here in memory of her.

Rest in Power Ola, You were the brightest kid I ever knew.
Feb 19 is a dark day that will never brighten.
